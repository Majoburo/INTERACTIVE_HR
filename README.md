# INTERACTIVE_HR

## CODE AND DATA
This is the code behind [HR](https://majoburo.github.io).
Data were taken from Gaia's 2nd data release and SDSS, crossmatched to within 3 arcsec radius.
The sample includes all stellar spectra within 200 parsecs with a S/N > 30.

## PLOT DESCRIPTION

The axes in the "HR" (for [Hertzsprung Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram)) plot are actually color and absolute magnitude, normally refered to as a color-magnitude diagram. The y-axis corresponds to luminiosity and the x-axis corresponds to temperature. Left to right is hotter to colder, bottom to top is dimmer to brighter.
The bottom plot is the spectrum of the star under your cursor. It's the intensity of each wavelength of light emitted by the star.

## COOL FEATURES

- Most stars have a [black body emission curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body) and [absorption lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line) on top due to cooler atmospheric layers outside of their hot cores. Some of them even have emission lines due to a hotter exterior! Can you identify the ones that do? What do they have in common?
- Notice the main blob that goes from bottom right to top middle. This is the [main sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence). As stars age, they move up the main sequence.
- Look at the bottom left corner. Those are the spectra of [white dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf). They have clear, broad lines, compare them with other stellar spectra in the main sequence. The lines in white dwarfs are broader. White dwarfs have higher surface gravity, which means they have higher pressures, which scatters the electrons around and broadens their lines. The lowest white dwarfs are cooler and have narrower (or even hidden) absorption lines.
- Looking at the main sequence: Stars with lower temperatures are redder, to the right, and stars with higher temperatures are bluer, to the left. Lower temperature stars have more molecular aborptions lines, which are much wider dips than element lines. Can you identify them? They correspond to red dwarfs within the main sequence.
- Look at the spectra of white dwarfs and then that of red dwarfs (the bottom part of the main sequence). Now look at the spectra between them. These are likely binaries of the two kinds of stars :).
- Look up the [Balmer series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmer_series). It's the series of atomic transitions of hydrogen. Can you identify the lines in the spectra? Which stars have clearer hydrogen lines? Why do you think that could be?
- There is a star within the white dwarfs that has splitting on both sides of the Balmer series lines. This is likely a heavily magnetized star. Can you find it?
